================================================================================
                        NON-FUNCTIONAL FEATURES
                    (Planned but Not Yet Implemented)
================================================================================

1. CONTACT SALES FUNCTIONALITY
   Status: UI exists but no backend implementation
   Description: The Enterprise pricing tier displays a "Contact Sales" button
   that currently has no functionality. When implemented, this would allow
   potential enterprise customers to submit sales inquiries directly from the
   pricing page, triggering email notifications to the sales team and storing
   leads in a CRM system.

2. MONEYGRAM INTEGRATION
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL - Supabase project URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY - Supabase anonymous key
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY - Service role key (server-only)

EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES
---------------------
- CoinGecko API (free tier, 10-50 calls/min)

REPOSITORY
----------
https://github.com/pkprajapati7402/Lume

PRODUCTION STATUS
-----------------
- Production-ready with all core features functional
- PWA-ready with manifest
- SEO optimized
- All hydration errors resolved
-  Status: No implementation
   Description: A dedicated portal where employees can log in to view their
   payment history, update their wallet addresses, set payment preferences,
   download tax documents, and manage their profile. This would complement the
   employer dashboard and provide transparency to payees about their earnings
   and transaction history.

5. MULTI-SIGNATURE WALLET SUPPORT
   Status: No implementation
   Description: Multi-signature (multi-sig) functionality would require multiple
   authorized signers to approve payments before they're submitted to the
   Stellar network. This is critical for enterprises where financial controls
   require approval workflows, preventing unauthorized payments and adding an
   extra security layer for large transactions or bulk payroll processing.
